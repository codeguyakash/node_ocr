# Image to Word Document Converter

This Express.js application uses the Google Cloud Vision API to extract text from an uploaded image and converts it into a well-formatted Word document (`.docx`). The generated document preserves the formatting such as bold, italics, bullet points, and indentation based on the extracted text.

## Features

- Upload an image to extract text.
- Automatically formats the extracted text into a `.docx` document.
- Supports bullet points, numbering, bold, italics, and indentation.
- Downloads the generated document after processing.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or higher recommended)
- Google Cloud Vision API credentials (JSON key file)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/webartsol/GoogleOCR.git
   cd GoogleOCR
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run google
   ```

## How to Obtain `credentials.json` for Google Cloud Vision API

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing project.
3. Navigate to the **API & Services** > **Credentials** section.
4. Click **Create Credentials** and choose **Service Account**.
5. Fill in the required details and select the role **Project > Editor**.
6. After creating the service account, go to **Keys** and click **Add Key** > **Create New Key**.
7. Select JSON as the key type, and a file named `credentials.json` will be downloaded to your computer.
8. Save this file in the root directory of your project.

## Google Cloud Vision API Endpoint for OCR

To use Google Cloud Vision for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), the API endpoint is as follows:

- **Endpoint URL**: `https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/images:annotate`

This endpoint processes images to detect and extract text using the `TEXT_DETECTION` or `DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION` features. To make requests, you must include your API key or authenticate with the `credentials.json` obtained earlier.
